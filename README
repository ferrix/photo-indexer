I've had a problem with digital photos coming from multiple tiers. Every device
(phone, camera) has its own naming convention so it is hard to put them into
common place. I eventually ended up into chaos where I had photos in various
devices and didn't really have the time to manually organize them into any kind
of directory hierarchy.

In order to address this problem I created this small piece of software that
copies them to given place with filenames that are easy merge and have a logical
organization. New filename consist of timestamp of the photograph and MD5 sum of
photographs file contents.

The indexer supports standard image types and Canon CR2 raw format.
